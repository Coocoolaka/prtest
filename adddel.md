Nested functions, as introduced in Nested Functions, are a convenient means of naming and defining self-contained blocks of code as part of a larger function. However, it is sometimes useful to write shorter versions of function-like constructs without a full declaration and name. This is particularly true when you work with functions or methods that take functions as one or more of their arguments.

Because the sorting closure is passed as an argument to a method, Swift can infer the types of its parameters and the type of the value it returns. The sort(_:) method is being called on an array of strings, so its argument must be a function of type (String, String) -> Bool. This means that the (String, String) and Bool types do not need to be written as part of the closure expressionâ€™s definition. Because all of the types can be inferred, the return arrow (->) and the parentheses around the names of the parameters can also be omitted:
